<code>1. DESCRIPTION:</code><br><br> A game created with the Unity Engine using the Mirror asset for network connections.
                <br>It is a text-based game in which the collective decisions of the players determine how the story unfolds.
                <br>Make decisions quickly before the sand flows from the hourglass! Otherwise, the story may take its course in the wrong way...
                <br>In the game we can create a lobby for 3 players - it is with them that we will make decisions and travel through the game world together.
                <br>Each player has the opportunity to find unique items during the journey. However, do not worry if your companion has found something interesting! 
                <br>Everything goes into your common inventory (After all, you have a common goal, right?).
                <br>In the game there is also a system of notifications (pings), which we can use to let other players know what option we want to vote for.<br> 
                
<code>2. HOW TO PLAY:</code>
                <br><br>The preffered resolution is full HD
                <br><br> If you use Unity Editor: Make sure that your build contains all scenes.
               	<br><br>Open 3 clients simulating each player. Only one player on the same network can host the game and create a lobby.
                <br>In this case, press the "Host Lobby" button in only one client. In the other two, press the "Join Lobby" button. 
                <br>The default network address when testing the game on the same device is "localhost".
                <br>If the address is incorrect: check if you are not using spaces and typed the address with a lowercase letter.<br>
<code>3. SCRIPTS:</code>     <br><br>Go to Assets - > Scripts
                List of folders:
                <br><br>**Audio** - Contains scripts related to the music player and describing how the music is played in the game.
                <br><br>**Graphics** - Contains scripts related to the options menu that help you adjust graphic settings.
                           				 Most of these scripts are easily available in the asset store. Several of them have been modified for the game.
